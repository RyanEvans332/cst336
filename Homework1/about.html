            It is widely believed that the US government created Stuxnet during the George W. Bush administration. The US government as of 2018 has not yet confirmed or denied involvement with Stuxnet. Whoever created it was obviously extraordinarily skilled with coding and had the resources to find several first-day exploits on Windows and even obtain legitimate digitally signed drivers from Realtek and Jmicron. Kaspersky labs estimated that it was likely a team of ~10 coders working over the course of 2 years.
