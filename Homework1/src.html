                The group at Symantec that originally discovered the worm said that it was "by far the most complex piece of code that we've looked at. In a completely different league from anything weâ€™d ever seen before."
                Symantec was right to say this solely based on the premise that:
                <ul>
                    <li>Stuxnet exploited several zero-day bugs on Windows that were not even heard of at the time</li>
                    <li>Stuxnet injected itself into and exploited a micro-controller that wasn't even part of Windows</li>
                    <li>Stuxnet obtained two digitally signed drivers that should have been <i>impossible</i> to obtain</li>
                    
                </ul>
