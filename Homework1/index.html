                <p>Stuxnet was a virus discovered by the infosec community in 2010. The virus itself was likely developed and deployed around 2005 and exploited several Windows zero-day vulnerabilities. </p>
                
                <p>It managed to spread itself worldwide--and it spread itself <i>fast</i>. </p>
                
                <p>But the interesting thing?: Assuming you're the average person--<span class="emphasis">it was completely harmless.</span></p>
